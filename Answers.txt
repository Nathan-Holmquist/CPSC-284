Q1.

     Coeficient matrix would be [1,1]
                                [1,-1]
                                [2,1]
     Augmented matrix is: [5]
                          [3]
                          [8]

    x + y = 5
    x âˆ’ y = 3      from equations 1 and 2 we can get y = 1, x = 4
    2x + y = 8      however when plugged into the 3rd equation it ends up
                    with 9=8 which is invalid meaning this linear system is invalid
